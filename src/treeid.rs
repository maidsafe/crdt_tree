//! Implements TreeId, a trait for representing Tree (Node) Identifiers
//!
//! For usage/examples, see:
//!   examples/tree.rs
//!   test/tree.rs
//!
//! This code aims to be an accurate implementation of the
//! tree crdt described in:
//!
//! "A highly-available move operation for replicated trees
//! and distributed filesystems" [1] by Martin Klepmann, et al.
//!
//! [1] https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf
//!
//! For clarity, data structures in this implementation are named
//! the same as in the paper (State, Tree) or close to
//! (OpMove --> Move, LogOpMove --> LogOp).  Some are not explicitly
//! named in the paper, such as TreeId, TreeMeta, TreeNode, Clock.
